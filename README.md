# IntegerToSwedishWords

A javascript function that converts positive integers into swedish words.

## Example

Input (integer): 11331 \
Output (string): "elvatusen trehundratrettioett" \
 \
Input (integer): 123 \
Output (string): "etthundratjugotre"

## Usage

Feel free to use this function the way you like it. Commercial use or private projects, I don't mind.

## Why did I make this function?

I got into a discussion with my friend that this could be useful to have for a couple of reasons. After some reasearching we didn't find an existing function like this with a support for the Swedish language. So I took on the challenge myself.

## Disclaimer

This is the first version of the function and I know it not optimized to it's maximum potential. Let me know if you would like an updated version.
The function works fine for my own personal use so im not planning on doing any updates in the near future if it's not highly requested.
