# IntegerToSwedishWords
A converter to convert positive integers into swedish words.

### Example
#### Input (integer): 11331
#### Output (string): "elvatusen trehundratrettioett" 

### Why did i make this function?
I got into a discussion with my friend that this could be useful to have for a couple of reasons. After some reasearching we didn't find an existing function like this with a support for the Swedish language. So I took on the challenge myself.

### Disclaimer
This is the first update of the function and I havent refactorized it into a cleaner code yet. Let me know if you would like an updated version.
The function works fine for my own personal use so im not planning on doing any updates in the near future if it's not requested.
